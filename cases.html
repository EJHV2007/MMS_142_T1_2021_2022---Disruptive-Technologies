          Chest X-rays are the primary method of detecting Pneumonia. CheXnet was fed with an input of frontal X-rays and it gives
          an output of a diagnosis and a detailed heatmap. It was then presented with new data sets and competed against 4 practicing radiologists.
          The result was CheXnet achieved a higher average score than the radiologists.

            Despite incredible progress in the field of artificial learning, technology still remains far from human learning.
            To further research in Artificial Intelligence, understanding how human problem-solving ability was studied through
            the use of video games to question whether or not AI should learn like humans. Human players and Reinforcement Learning
            were tasked to play a game with no instructions.

        The human participants easily solved the original game with a simple pink enemy,
        a key, and a door within minutes. In different versions of the game, objects were replaced with simple colored squares and it was
        continuously altered by replacing visual cues, changing object interaction, textures, control methods, and orientation. Humans
        struggled as their prior knowledge became a hindrance in solving the tasks whereas Reinforcement Learning took the same amount of
        effort across all versions.

          Advancements in the field of Artificial Learning have led to incredible feats surpassing human ability.
          Progress is slow for reinforcement learning that utilizes a process of small incremental changes. The initial wave
          of Reinforcement learning requires large quantities of data and is said to be fundamentally different from human learning. <br>
          Deep Reinforcement Learning (image on the left) <br><br>

          Certain variations were later developed to overcome the slow process of incremental learning like Episodic Deep Reinforcement
          learning and Meta-Reinforcement Learning. Episodic Deep Reinforcement Learning uses past experiences to make new decisions. Reinforcement
          learning is able to assess the current state internally and compare it with previous events.  This overcomes the slow changes in incremental
          approaches however, it still relies on slow learning.

  Meta Reinforcement Learning leverages previous experiences to speed up learning. The process of learning to learn is found to help create biases
  that allow Reinforcement learning to narrow down hypotheses for faster decision making. On the other hand, Episodic Meta Reinforcement Learning utilizes both methods which allow the system to bring up solutions based on previous tasks. <br> <br>
  Fast learning in AI currently still relies on slow learning. Episodic Deep Reinforcement Learning, Meta Reinforcement Learning, and Episodic Meta
  Reinforcement Learning still rely on information generated by slow incremental learning.

          Artificial intelligence developed by NVIDIA, Aalto University, and MIT, is able to restore images without access to clean data.
           Previous AI research involved the use of clean and noisy pairs of images to train neural networks. This new research has developed
           an AI capable of restoring, denoising, and even removing text from corrupted image inputs. The results are able to exceed the traditional
           clean data training method.

          Rich Sutton is an award-winning research scientist who is known as one of the founders of modern reinforcement learning.
          He says that research in the field is often done in a way for AI to leverage human knowledge. Researchers tend to treat computational
           resources as constant and human knowledge is assumed as the only way to advance artificial intelligence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class=" align-items-left p-0 text-left mx-0">
    <p class="mt-2">
      He cited the computer chess that defeated a world champion, Kasparov in 1997 was looked down upon by the majority of computer chess
      researchers that employed methods leveraging human intelligence. The search-based method was employed by computer chess and other researchers
      called “brute force” as an incorrect strategy citing that is not how humans play. <br> <br>

      Another example he gave was the research progress of computer Go where there was avoidance of the search-based method.
      This hindered progress for almost 20 years and when the search-based method was finally used, it made previous attempts to
      leverage human knowledge irrelevant.

      There are other instances he mentioned where researchers continue to use human knowledge as a way to develop AI but are later
      proven to be counterproductive. <br> <br>

      In the field of AI research, previous mistakes are not learned. AI researchers build with existing knowledge which is satisfying
      but will later plateau or hinder progress. Later their efforts are exceeded by an approach that is not focused on a human approach.

      He believes that AI should be built to discover the things we can and not to contain what we already have.
