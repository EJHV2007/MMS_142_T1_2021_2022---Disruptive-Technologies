                AI and the Global Economy
              </h4>

            <p class="mt-3">
              Nowadays, we can no longer consider Artificial Intelligence or AI as a ‘future technology’ but rather as something that we can utilize on a daily basis. AI has become so all-encompassing that we rely on it to take stunning photographs and even predict what we can say next in an email or text message. All of these developments helped artificial intelligence get closer to its initial objective of developing intelligent machines, which we're starting to see more of in our daily lives. Many everyday online conveniences are underpinned by artificial intelligence, from recommendations on our favorite retail sites to auto-generated photo tags on social media. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial enabler of disruptive innovation, resulting in game-changing goods and services that can serve low-end or unserved consumers and then transfer to the mainstream market. This technology is a driving force behind the current wave of disruptive innovation. For example, AI-enabled sharing economy is a new business model in which people can share their own assets with others as services in order to make better use of them and produce profit. This paradigm has been used successfully in a variety of sectors, including ride sharing, smart rapid prototyping, smart grids, and lodging. It is therefore no surprise that AI has and will continue to have a huge impact on the global economy.
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              According to Khamis, ‘it is estimated that the market for predictive analytics software will amount to more than $6.5 billion worldwide in 2019, advanced driver assistance systems will have a global market volume of $18 billion in 2019, compared to $5.6 billion in 2012, global voice recognition market in enterprise, consumer, and healthcare is to reach $113 billion in 2017, compared to $53 billion in 2012 and natural language processing market is anticipated to become worth more than $9.9 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion is 2013’. It is also due to these forecasts that investors have increased their funding in AI startups in fields such as ‘natural language processing, predictive analytics and deep learning’. While some industries, sectors, and individual firms are further forward than others, AI as a whole is still in its infancy. From a macroeconomic standpoint, developing markets have the potential to outperform their more developed counterparts. This only proves the vast potential of AI in ‘transforming the productivity and GDP of the global economy’.
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              The PWC’s Global Artificial Intelligence Study suggests that ‘45% of total economic gains by 2030 will come from product enhancements, stimulating consumer demand. This is because AI will drive greater product variety, with increased personalisation, attractiveness and affordability over time’. The study also states that the greatest economic gains from AI will be coming from China and North America which would amount to a total of $10.7 trillion and would account for 70% of the overall global economic impact. AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion1 to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined. This projection is made possible by the fact that more and more business leaders have taken to adopting AI and machine learning during the COVID crisis.
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              Instead of causing a standstill in the adoption of analytics and AI, research by the PWC shows that the pandemic has in fact accelerated the entire process. It is estimated that this momentum will continue well beyond the 2020s. At present, 86% of companies included in the PWC study have reported that AI has since become a ‘mainstream technology’. In a survey conducted by the AI Journal, 72% of business leaders said that they are confident about the role that AI will play in the future. Most of these executives (a whooping 74%) are certain that AI will continue to deliver efficient business processes despite the ongoing pandemic. They are thus able to shift the tide by taking advantage of what data analytics and AI has to offer.
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              As a disruptive technology, however, there are several attempts to make a prediction that results in the total level of employment at a national or global level where the skills shortage and surplus fluctuate in the future. AI might threaten to displace workers whether they be skilled or unskilled. In general, the employment outlook is formed by a mix of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and powerful firms' and investors' decisions, which necessitate present and expected future industries, as well as an uncertain number of economic cycles. Furthermore, the many economic determinants might create complicated obstacles in predicting with any precision how job growth and displacement will likely progress in the following years. The majority of forecasters, analysts, developers, scientists, technology suppliers, and economists are disputing whether AI's learning capabilities can be evolved or accelerated, as well as its potential impact on society. To this end, the wisest course of action will be to begin planning for a variety of scenarios.
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              According to Rob Jekielek, general director of Harris Poll, ‘AI is a vital factor in finding answers to what is expected to be on-going, ever-changing skills needs and training. Through career transition support tools, AI is already beginning to help fill skills shortages in the existing workforce.’ Employees are also benefiting from AI by adopting digital assistants and in-house AI-driven training programs to execute their current and evolving roles better and faster. By augmenting support operations, AI will also help to ease skills shortages. In fact, ‘there is an increasing need for support workers because more and more products are either digital products or other sorts of technology products with user interfaces. Many simple inquiries can be answered by a properly trained chatbot, relieving at least some of the load. Similarly, natural language processing systems may do rudimentary page scanning, which is frequently used for more canned phrases.’
             </p>

             <p class="mt-3">
              The next wave of corporate expansion and innovation will mostly likely be data-driven. As the world emerges from the Covid crisis, there will be chances for entrepreneurs, business leaders, and innovators to create value and develop new companies that can be quickly re-configured and re-aligned as client needs shift. Artificial intelligence and analytics, for example, will play a vital role in enhancing company innovation and advancement, as well as spurring new business models, in this climate. We owe our current position to decades of artificial intelligence development. And there will be decades more of sophisticated human-to-machine interactions in the future

                 How Far We Have Gone
             </h4>

             <p class="mt-3">
               Disruption has always been the next step on the path towards evolution. We, as a society, owe much of our growth to
               the innovators that have challenged normalcy, severed monotony, and sought methods to improve the way things are done.
               Creation comes forth from disruption - that is known.
             </P>

             <p class="mt-3">
               Given the leaps they have made in regards to a variety of industries (i.e., medical technology, video games, and
               education), AI and machine learning are far from their early stages. Researchers from the Dartmouth Summer Research
               Project in New Hampshire back in 1956, despite their enthusiasm in the idea of "thinking machines," would not have
               expected any of the innovations made by modern scientists today, such as Richard Sutton on modern reinforcement learning
               and the researchers under CheXNet.
             </P>

             <p class="mt-3">
                AI is inherently versatile. Research studies further discover methods that allow it to be utilized in situations even
                outside the realm of science and technology, allowing it and machine learning to grow into a juggernaut of industry,
                themselves, and a subject of interest to many business sectors. In an article written by Christina Pazzanese for The
                Harvard Gazette around artificial intelligence, it was reported that worldwide business spending on AI would amass a
                whopping $50 billion this year and $110 billion annually by 2024 despite the economic crisis occurring in correspondence
                to the ongoing pandemic. With that in mind, it is safe to say that there is not much to worry about whether its goal to
                shake things up within and without the science and technology field would persist.
            </p>

           <h4 class="mt-1">
             Where We Need To Go
           </h4>

           <p class="mt-3">
             One thing is for certain - AI and machine learning, in their full potential, have an innate ability to disrupt every aspect of society’s daily life. Whether that specific disruption is positive or negative is unknown. At the moment, only time and the specific measures we take will tell. People's perception towards technology has regularly fluctuated throughout the previous decades. While conversations about its apparent negative influence on society have been brought up, the changes it has provided alone make it challenging to imagine a world where it did not play a huge role.
           </P>

           <p class="mt-3">
             Much like any measures humanity needs to take to solidify progress, continuous pursuit requires caution. One persisting challenge that AI and machine learning concern the ethical issues surrounding its study and eventual use.
           </P>

           <p class="mt-3">
             In a study done by Bernd Carsten Stahl on the topic on March 18 this year, he explains the underlying problems on the development, deployment, and use of AI. Overall, some of the 39 ethical issues identified from the case studies enumerated in the study are security problems, the disappearance of jobs, power asymmetries, lack of accuracy of data, contested ownership of data, and violation of fundamental human rights of end-users. While striving to improve lives is a noble mission, horrible ramifications can always occur regardless of its intention.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Understanding its pitfalls will allow both creators and users to be warier when utilizing the technology - to know that there are boundaries that should not be crossed at any cost. Hopefully, everyone keeps these warning signs in mind on AI and machine learning's ongoing journey toward massive disruption.
