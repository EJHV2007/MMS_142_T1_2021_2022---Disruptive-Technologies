                 How Far We Have Gone
             </h4>
    
             <p class="mt-3 mb-5">
               Disruption has always been the next step on the path towards evolution. We, as a society, owe much of our growth to
               the innovators that have challenged normalcy, severed monotony, and sought methods to improve the way things are done.
               Creation comes forth from disruption - that is known.
             
              Given the leaps they have made in regards to a variety of industries (i.e., medical technology, video games, and
               education), AI and machine learning are far from their early stages. Researchers from the Dartmouth Summer Research
               Project in New Hampshire back in 1956, despite their enthusiasm in the idea of "thinking machines," would not have
               expected any of the innovations made by modern scientists today, such as Richard Sutton on modern reinforcement learning
               and the researchers under CheXNet. 
             
                AI is inherently versatile. Research studies further discover methods that allow it to be utilized in situations even
                outside the realm of science and technology, allowing it and machine learning to grow into a juggernaut of industry,
                themselves, and a subject of interest to many business sectors. In an article written by Christina Pazzanese for The
                Harvard Gazette around artificial intelligence, it was reported that worldwide business spending on AI would amass a
                whopping $50 billion this year and $110 billion annually by 2024 despite the economic crisis occurring in correspondence
                to the ongoing pandemic. With that in mind, it is safe to say that there is not much to worry about whether its goal to
                shake things up within and without the science and technology field would persist.

                Where We Need To Go
            </h4>
         
            <p class="mt-3">
                One thing is for certain - AI and machine learning, in their full potential, have an innate ability to disrupt every aspect
                of societyâ€™s daily life. Whether that specific disruption is positive or negative is unknown. At the moment, only time and
                the specific measures we take will tell. People's perception towards technology has regularly fluctuated throughout the
                previous decades. While conversations about its apparent negative influence on society have been brought up, the changes it
                has provided alone make it challenging to imagine a world where it did not play a huge role.

                Much like any measures humanity needs to take to solidify progress, continuous pursuit requires caution. One persisting
                challenge that AI and machine learning concern the ethical issues surrounding its study and eventual use.
