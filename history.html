                <p class="mt-3">
                    Artificial intelligence, at its core, aims to imitate human intelligence by way of machines systems. The beginnings
                    of artificial intelligence can be traced back on 1956 in the Darthmouth Summer Research Project in new Hampshire.
                    Researchers from fields of language simulation, neuron nets, complexity theory and more discussed the idea of
                    "thinking machines". The birth of artificial intelligence has affected multiple fields like engineering, mathematics,
                    computer science, and alike.

                <p class="mt-3">
                    In the 1960s, the innovation in the field of AI grew rapidly. The creation of new programming languages, robots and automatons became popular.
                    Algorithms that can solve mathematical problems were created. Computer scientist and professor, Joseph Weizenbaum, developed the very first chatbox
                    in 1966 named ELIZA. ELIZA is an interactive computer program that could functionally converse in English with a person. Weizenbaum aimed to demonstrate
                    that it is possible for the human mind to communicate with an artificially intelligent mind.

                </h4>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Disruptive technology is the technology that affects the normal operation of a market or an industry. It displaces a
                    well-established product or technology, creating a new industry or market. In businesses theory, disruptive technology
                    follows the tradition of identifying radical technical change and the creation of tools for its use at a firm or even
                    policy level. As opposed to sustainable technologies, disruptive technologies, affects the way businesses, consumers,
                    and even industries function.

                    Artificial intelligence is a way of simulating the human mind. With electronic capacity and functionality increasing
                    at an exponential rate, the capability of artificial intelligence extends from the simple automation to complex tasks.
                    Its influence has extended to several aspects of human life and which businesses has taken advantage of.

                <p class="mt-3 mb-5">
                    The power of artificial intelligence lies in its speed of execution, power of automation, ability to use complex
                    equations, and accuracy of analysis. In industries, multiple tasks can be done by machines which are controlled by artificial intelligence;
                    increasing production while decreasing cost. In businesses, artificial intelligence is used as predictive models in order to
                    make future decisions. They are also used more intricately when dealing with the consumers of their product by using chatbots or
                    suggesting products based on market trend. In everyday life, artificial intelligence is present in daily activities, such as
                    social media and in simply searching the internet. The platforms you use recommend links or posts based on gathered data and
                    trend.

                  Artificial intelligence is progressively being used in healthcare. AI Technologies have different roles and tasks that fully support a specific healthcare field.
                  Examples are machine learning, natural language processing, rule-based expert systems, physical robots, and robotic process automation. These technologies can
                  revolutionize areas of medicine such as better organized healthcare logistics, mining medical records, diagnosis and treatment plans, administrative applications,
                  drug creation, etc. Even though AI technologies are garnering attention in the medical field, real-life implementation is still a challenge, and the restrictions
                  are the first key barrier. There are currently no standards to examine the safety and efficacy of AI systems under existing regulations. It is also evident that
                  AI systems will not easily replace the roles of clinicians but will suffice the care for patients. Watch this <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IsZeFR_Rk"> video of the Medical
